# ReviewsMining

Web scraping is fun to do. This repository provides a flexible way to scrape online reviews of different products available on amazon and flipkart. The main aim of scraping these reviews is to use these reviews given by various customers for performing 'Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining' on those reviews. This can help a manufacturer to get a fair idea how happy are the customers with their products. Also the scripts help to scrape reviews, you might need to clean them before using. 

Though the scripts provided in the code can scrap efficiently but they are structure dependent. The web structure used by amazon and flipkart may differ at the time you are using it, so a little bit changes may be needed at in the script at that time.

For running the scripts, you need to install the following:
* Python 3.xx
* BeautifulSoup4 
* requests

`BeautifulSoup4` and `requests` can be installed easily with the help of `pip`
